First, build the module:

- set NDRX_HOME (for example, "export NDRX_HOME=/opt/endurox/6.5")
- make sure that you use the desired version of python on the command 
  line ("export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH")
- run "python setup.py build --force"
- run "python setup.py install" to install in PYTHON_LIB/site-packages/endurox
- a package endurox will be built, with the shared objects atmi.so 
  and atmiws.so in it. 
- for documentation, see the examples in the testclient.py and pyserver.py 
  files in the "test" directory

To run the example / test:

- cd test
- the IPC key is set to 77662 and the WSH port is 7766. Adjust in "ubbconfig"
  and ""setenv" if you need other values.
- source setenv (". ./setenv") - make sure you still have NDRX_HOME set
- run "make" to build NDRXCONFIG, QFS and the executables for server and clients
- run "tmboot -y"
- run "testclient.py". This will test the ATMI interface
- run "send.py" to test a conversation
- run "simpcl.py", equivalent of $NDRX_HOME/apps/simpapp 
- run "make clean" when you are done. This also cleans up IPC resources
